total_timeline 1			# total timeline (i.e. logical process) in the model.
tick_per_second 6			# tick is the simulation time unit. E.g., 6 means one second has 10^6 ticks (i.e. the time unit is microsecond). O means the time unit is second.
run_time 10000				# simulation run-time in second. Actually it is the run-time of one epoch, and the system run one epoch in default.
seed 0					# seed for random number generator (a non-negative integer number). Simulation results are repeatable for the same seed.
enable_openvz_emulation true		# whether openvz-based emulation is enabled
openvz_emulation_type 1			# 0 - simulator and emulated hosts on same physical machine, 1 - distributed emulation over TCP/IP; work only when enable_openvz_emulation = true
